Introduction to Rails at the Melbourne Ruby Nuby night
---
<p>Last night we ran the inaugural Ruby Nuby night at the Melbourne Ruby users group. The night was a massive success with about 50 people in attendance. The night was organised into two halves, a Ruby half and a Rails half, punctuated by a pizza and softdrink break.

I did the general introduction to Rails; I wasn't aiming for anything technical, I just kept it high level to try and interest people in Rails. I've put the slides down below.
<strong>EDIT:</strong> A more recent post has the youtube presentation

I will probably get a reputation as the guy who called DHH a tool (in a recorded talk no less!) so I think I should put it in context. DHH is a super smart guy who has built what I believe to be the best web framework around so massive kudos is deservedly thrown his way. I just get tired of the massive flamewars that spark up around DHH a little too often to be called coincidences. When you're out there trying to get people on board with the new framework it becomes a bit of an embarrassment when the developer corner of the internet gets caught in a week long pissing contest.But mostly I was just going for a cheap laugh.</p>
