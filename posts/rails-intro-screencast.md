And now with audio - Melbourne Ruby Nuby night redux
---
<p>Marty from <a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/">cogent consulting</a> was kind enough to record screencasts of all our presentations from the Ruby Nuby night. Cogent are also being super nice and hosting them all on their <a href="http://www.cogentconsulting.com.au/screencasts/">screencasts</a> page.</p>
<p>I've also put mine up on youtube to get a widget - which after a number of unsuccessful attempts should now be embedded below.</p>
