Presentation at webjam
---
<p>Monday night (25th June, 2007) I presented alltimetop5 at webjam. I was lucky enough to meet the guy who runs these, <a href="http://lachstock.com.au/">Lachlan </a>at Railscamp the other weekend who signed me up. It was a little weird getting up in front of a whole bunch of Microsofties to present a rails app but it went down well. I ended up getting third place in the voting for best presentation. The prize was a Wacom tablet that I'm having a lot of fun playing with.

I've put the slides up on slideshare and embedded them below.
