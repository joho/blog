I work on the web
---
<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/lisaherrod/">Lisa Herrod</a> has started a bit of a meme with the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/iworkontheweb/"> &quot;i work on the web&quot;</a> photos popping up on flickr.</p>
<p>It's really cool to get a more personal view of all the people working in our space. I've <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/johotravels/1327935695/">put mine up</a> and I recommend anyone else working on the web does the same.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong><a href="http://toolmantim.com/">Tim</a> has whipped up a homepage for this thing, you can find it at <a href="http://iworkontheweb.com/">iworkontheweb.com</a>. Very cool stuff, mad props to Tim, Lisa, and Lach for getting this happening.</p>
