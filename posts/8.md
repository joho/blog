New blog in Camping!
---
<p>I've recently changed hosting for my blog and I thought this would be a wonderful chance to learn the camping framework and write it myself.</p>
<p>
Development was easy enough - deploying when you don't have any internet at home to plug your laptop into and your workplace blocks every port - not so easy.</p>
<p>There are still a few bugs and I haven't implemented feeds just yet but I'll get to those as soon as I get a minute. Planning for the Norway move and wrapping things up at work is taking up a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Please note that some of the dates in the atom feed are a bit messed up. I didn't alter any of the dates when I imported my wordpress articles. Everything should be good soon.</p>
