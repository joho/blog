My personal website and blog

TODO
---

 * update copy so it's not so lame anymore
 * fix blog styles so the pre tags don't look like arse
 * ATOM FEEDS (and change my feedburner stuff)
 * integrate with envato developer blog (i really don't want to write posts twice)
 * add fitness/weight tracking - shame is the best motivator
