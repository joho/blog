Programing Languages and Techniques as Different Toolboxes
---

Giles' [Do you believe in magic](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2009/07/do-you-believe-in-magic.html) post hits the nail right on the head. It reminded me of Joel Spolsky's [Law of Leaky Abstractions](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html) except that it comes at the topic from a different direction. Joel talks about the layers of abstraction between the code you're writing and the code the machine is running, and how that can fail you. In a way, Giles talks about developers adding another level of abstraction - in their programming technique (or mindset, or whatever you would call it) - where code can be "magic".

When you start working with this abstraction (leaky as it is) I bet that you are thinking of something like this.
